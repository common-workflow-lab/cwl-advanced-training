# CWL Advanced Training

This is an advanced tour of Common Workflow Language features.  The
audience for this training should have some basic familiarity with
CWL.  The goal is to provide awareness of features that exist in order
to give learners a toolkit for solving their problems with CWL.

If you are completely new to CWL, you should go through [getting
started training](https://www.commonwl.org/rnaseq-training/) and then
return here.

The training presentation is available as [CWL Advanced Training.pdf](slides/CWL%20Advanced%20Training.pdf)
and [CWL Advanced Training.odp](slides/CWL Advanced Training.odp).
